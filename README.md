# Platform Console Backend

This project contains the following backend services for the PNDA console:

- The [Data Logger](console-backend-data-logger/README.md) service receives metrics to be displayed in the console.
- The [Data Manager](console-backend-data-manager/README.md) service provides data to the frontend, and wraps calls to other services. 
- The Utils project contains utility functions used by both services.
